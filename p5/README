OVERVIEW:

  This java application lets user to play a mine game starting from right bottom 
  corner on the grid trying to avoid hidden mine. While playing game user gets 
  several options like show mine show path. 


INCLUDED FILES:

  * README -this files
  * MineWalker.java - Driver
  * MineWalkerPanel.java - Class with methods
  * RandomWalk.java - Creates the random path

BUILDING AND RUNNING:
  
  All prject is in the same directory
  
  From the Directory containing the .java sorce code, compile the program:
      $ javac MineWalker.java
      
  From the program, the directory containing MineWalker.class:
      $ java MineWalker
      
  The user will not be prompted to input any value in the begining. But user will
  have an option to setup there grid dimension as prefered. The default grid dimension 
  is set to 10*10.

PROGRAM DESIGN:

  The MineWalkerPanel extends Jpanel, it has all the method and attributes of Jpanel.
  The Constructor MineWalkerPanel() has all panels,labels, button and slider. The center
  panel is buttons where the game is actually played. The buttons change there labels when clicked
  for "New Game" to "Give up", "Show Path" to "Hide Path" and "Show Mines" to "Show Mine". 
  The panel also contains a slider.The panel has a JTextField where user can input the grid 
  size and the Text field is setup in a way that it will not accept any other string or double value.
  if entered it will reset to default value i.e 10.
  
  The top part is topPanel where user can see the score update. It holds the user current score.
  The games has labels 
  
  * Green:  zero mines in the four adjacent tiles
  * Yellow:  one mine in the four adjacent tilesI
  * Orange: two mines in the four adjacent tiles
  * Red: three mines in the four adjacent tiles

  Mines gebnerated is random taking the gridDimension. The program uses Project 3 random walk file
  to generate a path. The game is setup in a way that it has one possible path all the time
  
  The score scheme is if the user reaches the top of the panel without loosing 5 lifes they will win.
  If the user looses 5 lifes before reaching the final will lose. 

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

 I have used 2D array to buid the program, it made the code look good and took less time.
 but i faced alot of problem setting up mines and implementing it on the grid. Minewhile i 
 was facing the problem revalidating the game, every time i was hitting new game i was 
 getting null pointer and finally after 3 hours of hit and trial i figured that i was making 
 two different gridDimension so it was removing the prvious and kept on adding the old panel.
 I have tried to create methods as much as possible to make it look good.
 
 I personally enjoyed doing this program though i faced alot of problem in the begining
 understanding concept. I have tested the game everyway and even tried to break it by making
 the grid dimension big and puting string the gridSize text field. But everything seemed to work fine.
 the color are labeled on the right hand side of the panel. 
 
EXTRA CREDIT: 

I did set up the slider but i was not able to figure to work.
