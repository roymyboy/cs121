  I did debugging in the followig .java files
* DebuggerTest2

  I started with eclipse. I downloaded all the fies and tried to run it. When I was running the DebuggerTest2.java 
  Ithad some error so I run debug on it and saw the issue was on line 11 with the for loop. with the sign operators.
  I erased the "=" sign and that fixed.

* FindRoute.java
  As I was going through the debugger each line I saw the semi colon in the code in the while loop and fixed the 
  the cpde was never entering the loop. when I came down to inside the code the debugger took me to the Car.java

* Car.java
  When it took me to the direction i saw the direction was messed up and it was taking to the wrong direction. 
  I fixed the EAST direction anfd the west direction. I made following changes.
	    nextMove = Direction.EAST;
            currentLocation.x++;
            nextMove = Direction.WEST;
            currentLocation.x--;
