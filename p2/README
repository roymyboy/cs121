OVERVIEW:

The PlayList class prompts three time fro user to input data after that program 
terminates and shows the average playtime of the input values followed by the 
song that is close to 240 second and finally a table showing all three songs 
according to the time length.


INCLUDED FILES;

All project and file is in same directory.

PlayList.java
Song.java
PlayMusic.java
input.txt
README

BUILDING AND RUNNING:


From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the program:
    $ javac PlayList.java

Run the program from the directory containing TrafficAnimation.class:
    $ java PlayList
    
To run the program by the given input:
    $ java PlayList < input.txt
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

The first part of the program prompts user to enter four different data 
for three songs which is artist, title, playtime, filename. Once the user
is done inputting the values the program takes the inputs and processes it
to print out the average playtime of all three songs in seconds.
 
The maximum and minimum values are found by the Math.max and Math.min.
 
Then the program prints out the time closest to 240 seconds that is done by 
substracting the time length between 240 seconds and time length of the song
individually using Math.abs. the song time is extractrd by getPlayTime. 


TESTING:

This program was tested by using input.txt and also by putting the manual inputs.
Couple of errors were encountered while compiling and  running it saying "String 
beyond the limit". After playing with it for awhile i was able to figure out and 
i added "index" instead of assigning the actual number values. 

 
DISCUSSION:

The program is pretty straight forward but requires close attention and focus.
The issues that i encountered were pretty simple and easily fixable after some research
from internet, books and instructors guidelines.i have tried not to hard code anything
in my program.
 
 
EXTRA CREDIT:

I added a play method in Song.java using PlayMusic.java. 
To paly song i called the method in PlayList.java.
Song1.play();, song2.java(); and song3.java();
