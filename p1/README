PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This Java application displays two vehicles traveling in opposite directions 
on a single two-lane road. The application also shows an observer is waiting 
to cross the road.   

INCLUDED FILES:

 * README - this file
 * TrafficAnimation.java - source code


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

All project and file is in same directory.

From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the program:
    $ javac TrafficAnimation.java

Run the program from the directory containing TrafficAnimation.class:
    $ java TrafficAnimation

As the code doesnot have any input value. It is not going to ask you
to input any values. All the values are assigned in the code.


PROJECT DESIGN NOTES:

The TrafficAnimation class extends the JPanel class. It has all of the properties
and methods of a JPanel. Jpanel contains the paint component method. 

PaintComponent method takes in the values like dimensions of shapes,strings, the colors 
and the postion of the object. It gets the values from the user by the use of
drawRect, drawString,drawArc setColor, newFont. 

All graphic elements are drawn relative to a single anchor point(x=-100) so that
when the window gets resized, the objects in the canvas gets resized too.


The avatar has been made completely out of ovals of different sizes.
Some of the ovals are inform of circle some are streached oval.



PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING NOTES:

The project was straight forward. I had some obstacles but with multiple attempt I got an idea of co-ordinates,
and figured out everything was supposed to be related to X and y- Co-ordinate. To re-scale I avoided hard coding.

I did a multiple tests to make sure the code works fine. I increased the height and width of the screen
and checked if the objects scaled properly or not, everything scaled as I wanted it to.


EXTRA CREDIT:

*I made the wheels spin.
  To rotate the wheels I associated the arc angle with "x" integer. which made the wheel spin.
  
*I made the transition smooth.
  For smooth wrapping I set the position of x way beyond the screen window.
  
*I made cars go in opposite direction in two different lanes. 
  To move the cars in the opposite direction I used the (-x+width). and it started moving form opposite direction.
